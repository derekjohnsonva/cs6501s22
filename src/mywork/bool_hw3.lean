- Data type -- inductive definition of a set of constructible terms
- Abstract data type (ADT) -- data type plus set of basic operations on values of this type
- Certified abstract data type (CADT) -- ADT with proofs of desired mathematical properties  

In this file, we see how to produce a CADT for Boolean algebra.

As we saw during the lecture, bugs in our "code"
are revealed by an inability to prove that our
implementations of these operations have all the
key mathematical properties of the operations in
the Boolean algebra that we're trying to implement. 
Try slightly changing the definition of "and" or 
"or" for example, and see if, and if so how, the
changes break the proof(s).
