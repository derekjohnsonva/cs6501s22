The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice
representing mathematical functions and relations both
computationally and logically (as parameterized inductive 
types in Prop along with all and only the appropriate 
proof constructors).

To do: Update your boo and nt homework to represent each
operation (currently implemented as a lambda abstraction
possibly with recursion) as an inductive family of Props;
then translate each test case encoded as an equality of
computed and expected values into a proposition and proof.
