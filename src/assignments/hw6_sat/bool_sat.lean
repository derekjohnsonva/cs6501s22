Our next goal is to implement a simple
Boolean satisfiablity solver. Here are 
the steps:

1. Compute set, V, of variables in expression
2. Compute list of all interpretations for V
3. Evaluate expression under each interpretation
4. Reduce list of Boolean results to final result

Side tasks:
1. Design and implement a set abstraction
2. ... more to come ...

Hints and help: 

1. You may assume that variable indices (as in "var.V 2"))
are allocated in ascending order with no skips. So if you
have an expression with variables X, Y, and Z, the would 
be (V 0), (V 1), and (V 2). You also have a function to 
compute the size of any "set" of variables. Given these 
two facts/assumptions, think of a way to take a set of
variables and return a list of interpretations for it.
