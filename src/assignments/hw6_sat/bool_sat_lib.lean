Hints and help: 

1. You may assume that variable indices (as in "var.V 2"))
are allocated in ascending order with no skips. So if you
have an expression with variables X, Y, and Z, the would 
be (V 0), (V 1), and (V 2). You also have a function to 
compute the size of any "set" of variables. Given these 
two facts/assumptions, think of a way to take a set of
variables and return a list of interpretations for it.
